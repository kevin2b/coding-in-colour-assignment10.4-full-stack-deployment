Note that if the site doesn't work, either the database expired or the instance is sleeping and requires time to boot up (as this site is using a free hosting plan).

Frontend: https://coding-in-colour-assignment10-4-full-xb2h.onrender.com/

Backend: https://coding-in-colour-assignment10-4-full.onrender.com/authors

(There are more backend API endpoints, but you only need the above one to get author_id for the frontend. **The focus of this assignment is more on the deployment aspect rather than functionality.** Improvements can be made such as better error handling in the frontend, better validation in the backend, not requiring user to find author_id by API, not reloading the page on some changes.)

Anonymous author has an id of 999 and is used as a default in some cases.

The frontend is partially provided by the instructor.

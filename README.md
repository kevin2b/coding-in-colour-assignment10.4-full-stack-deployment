Note that if the site doesn't work, either the database expired or the instance is sleeping and requires time to boot up (as this site is using a free hosting plan).

**Backend:** https://coding-in-colour-assignment10-4-full.onrender.com/authors (There are more backend API endpoints, but you only need this one to get author_id for the frontend. **Due to the free hosting plan, YOU MUST visit this endpoint and confirm the backend service is not sleeping before visiting the frontend. You may need to wait for a couple of minutes.**)

**Frontend:** https://coding-in-colour-assignment10-4-full-xb2h.onrender.com/  **Confirm the backend is not sleeping/wake up the backend before visiting.**

Anonymous author has an id of 999 and is used as a default in some cases.

(**The focus of this assignment is more on the deployment aspect rather than functionality.** Improvements can be made such as better error handling in the frontend, better validation in the backend, not requiring user to find author_id by API, not reloading the page on some changes.)

The frontend is partially provided by the instructor.
